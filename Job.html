<span class="verse-text">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <em>was</em> Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</span>

</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">

<span class="verse-text">And it was so, when the days of <em>their</em> feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings <em>according</em> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.

</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
