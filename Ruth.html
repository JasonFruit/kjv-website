</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">

</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">6</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</span>

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">

</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">14</span>
<span class="verse-text">And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</span>

</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">15</span>

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">22</span>
<span class="verse-text">So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</span>
</span>
</p><h3 id="2">2</h3>

<p class="verse-block">

</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">3</span>
<span class="verse-text">And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field <em>belonging</em> unto Boaz, who <em>was</em> of the kindred of Elimelech.</span>

</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">

</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">7</span>
<span class="verse-text">And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">8</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</span>

</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">9</span>
<span class="verse-text"><em>Let</em> thine eyes <em>be</em> on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of <em>that</em> which the young men have drawn.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">10</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I <em>am</em> a stranger?</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">11</span>
<span class="verse-text">And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and <em>how</em> thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</span>

<span class="verse-text">The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">13</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">14</span>
<span class="verse-text">And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched <em>corn</em>, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">15</span>
<span class="verse-text">And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</span>

</p>
<p class="verse-block">

</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">19</span>
<span class="verse-text">And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.

</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
