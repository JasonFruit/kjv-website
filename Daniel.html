<h2>Daniel</h2><h3 id="1">1</h3>

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">1</span>
<span class="verse-text">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">2</span>
<span class="verse-text">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">3</span>
<span class="verse-text">And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring <em>certain</em> of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">4</span>
<span class="verse-text">Children in whom <em>was</em> no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as <em>had</em> ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">5</span>
<span class="verse-text">And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">6</span>
<span class="verse-text">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">7</span>
<span class="verse-text">Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel <em>the name</em> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">8</span>
<span class="verse-text">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">9</span>
<span class="verse-text">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">10</span>
<span class="verse-text">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which <em>are</em> of your sort? then shall ye make <em>me</em> endanger my head to the king.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">11</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">12</span>
<span class="verse-text">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">13</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">14</span>
<span class="verse-text">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">15</span>
<span class="verse-text">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">16</span>
<span class="verse-text">Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">17</span>
<span class="verse-text">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">18</span>
<span class="verse-text">Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">19</span>
<span class="verse-text">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">20</span>
<span class="verse-text">And in all matters of wisdom <em>and</em> understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <em>and</em> astrologers that <em>were</em> in all his realm.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">21</span>
<span class="verse-text">And Daniel continued <em>even</em> unto the first year of king Cyrus.</span>
</span>
</p><h3 id="2">2</h3>

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">1</span>
<span class="verse-text">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">2</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">3</span>
<span class="verse-text">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">4</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">5</span>
<span class="verse-text">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">6</span>
<span class="verse-text">But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">7</span>
<span class="verse-text">They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">8</span>
<span class="verse-text">The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">9</span>
<span class="verse-text">But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, <em>there is but</em> one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">10</span>
<span class="verse-text">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore <em>there is</em> no king, lord, nor ruler, <em>that</em> asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">11</span>
<span class="verse-text">And <em>it is</em> a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">12</span>
<span class="verse-text">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">13</span>
<span class="verse-text">And the decree went forth that the wise <em>men</em> should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">14</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon:</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">15</span>
<span class="verse-text">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why <em>is</em> the decree <em>so</em> hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">16</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">17</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">18</span>
<span class="verse-text">That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">19</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">20</span>
<span class="verse-text">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">21</span>
<span class="verse-text">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">22</span>
<span class="verse-text">He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what <em>is</em> in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">23</span>
<span class="verse-text">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast <em>now</em> made known unto us the king's matter.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">24</span>
<span class="verse-text">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise <em>men</em> of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">25</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">26</span>
<span class="verse-text">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name <em>was</em> Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">27</span>
<span class="verse-text">Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise <em>men</em>, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">28</span>
<span class="verse-text">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">29</span>
<span class="verse-text">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came <em>into thy mind</em> upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">30</span>
<span class="verse-text">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for <em>any</em> wisdom that I have more than any living, but for <em>their</em> sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">32</span>
<span class="verse-text">This image's head <em>was</em> of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</span>

<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">35</span>
<span class="verse-text">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span>

<p class="verse-block">
<span class="verse">
<span class="verse-num">42</span>
<span class="verse-text">And <em>as</em> the toes of the feet <em>were</em> part of iron, and part of clay, <em>so</em> the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</span>
